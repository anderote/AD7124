# AD7124
A simple driver for the 4-Channel, Low Noise, Low Power, 24-Bit, Sigma-Delta ADC with PGA and Reference

This project was originally forked from https://github.com/jjuliano77/ad7124 which itself is based on https://github.com/epsilonrt/ad7124

This version has implemented the matched current source inside the AD7124 which can provide different levels of current, from 50uA to 1mA, to either of the active analog input pins.
